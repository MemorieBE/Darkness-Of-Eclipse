Find the 7 keys and escape.
-"Remember the past" This key might be located in a place that I've been before, but the only thing I remember is the park bench in the forest.
-"Learn who you were" This key must be near some sort reminder of myself. Could it be a photograph? A dairy, maybe? Perhaps it's in the house. / "Learn who you were" I think I saw this key in the house on the second floor. I believe it was in some sort of storage room.
-"Resist what you couldn't" What exactly couldn't I resist? I know that something must have happened to me. Did I die? I don't know.
-"Fix where it hurts" I can only see this being taken literally, like it's telling me that the key is in a hospital or a medkit or something.
-"Breathe in the air" This key also seems literal in a sense, but what exactly relates to air in any way? It could be a tree or something.
-"Break through the pain" I assume this means I need to break through something. This key must be located inside something tough.
-"Reject the Unver" I'm having trouble figuring out this last one. I remember the voice telling me that this was one of the grey woman's names.
