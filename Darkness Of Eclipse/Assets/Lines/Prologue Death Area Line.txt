It all ends in the same way, doesn't it? Every possibility, all the possible timelines, and they all end with the same conclusion. There's got to be a way out of this, right? There's got to be a way I can change the inevitable. Am I just destined to roam this world until the end of eternity? No. I can prove that I can change destiny, no matter how many timelines it will take. Even if it means I have to reset our reality itself.
