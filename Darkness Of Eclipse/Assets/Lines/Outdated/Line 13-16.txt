Welcome back. 
I don't mean to alarm you, 
but you've been asleep for approximately 7 and a half years, 
well this version of you has.

Have you ever stopped to think about how small we are? 
Not just to our universe, but to our reality as well. 
People always assume that the multiverse is infinite because of how big it is, 
but if you take into consideration that time and space can only be so specific, 
you'll find that eternity is very much finite. 
It's as beautiful as it is terrifying to think about, 
the fact that we will eventually repeat things due to our universe running out of original events, 
or maybe the future has already happened.

Sorry, I forgot how wonderful it was to share my thoughts and ideas with other people. 
Did I ever tell you how interesting your ideas were? 
Oh how I loved all those lost times when all we did was just talk and talk, 
of course, you wouldn't remember. 
We could go back to those times, you know. 
Maybe once you stop being afraid again, 
we could go back to being best friends forever. 
I missed you so much.

When you were alive, you built a gate around this forest and hid the 7 keys to the gate throughout in an attempt to keep the Unver out, 
but in your hurry, you forgot the possibility that she might already be within the gates, 
and that's how your story came to a dark conclusion.
I wrote a poem in order to remember where you hid those keys, but it's missing something.
I feel like I used to know what was missing, but now I don't.
It goes a little something like this.
Remember the past. Learn who you were.
Resist what you couldn't. fix where it hurts.
Breathe in the air. Break through the pain.
Reject the Unver...
