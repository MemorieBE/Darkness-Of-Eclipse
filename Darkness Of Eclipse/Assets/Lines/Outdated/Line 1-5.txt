Hello?

I can here something, someone is here, who are you?

You're not from here, aren't you? You're from somewhere else. Somewhere far, far away.

Don't be afraid, I know what it's like, waking up in a darkness you've never seen before. It can be terrifying.

You shouldn't be out here, it's not safe.
