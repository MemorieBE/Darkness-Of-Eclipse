Time is like a piece of string, it helps us understand how one thing leads to another. We use time everyday to tell us when to eat, sleep and wake up in the morning. Now obviously, time is much more complicated than just a schedule. It's one of the most fundemental building blocks of our existence and keeps our universe from falling apart. But there's a flaw with time, it's delicate and can break very very easily, and when time breaks, the universe shall burn.
