There isn't anything I can do to make up for what I did. I tried to protect you, but instead I dragged you down to the depths of hell. I don't expect you to forgive me, but I want you to promise me something. I want you to promise that you won't be afraid. It's a dark world we live in, empty like the dark side of the moon, but no matter how alone you feel, just remember that I'm still roaming this limbo with you. And no matter how much of yourself you lose, no matter how many memories you forget, just promise me that you will never forget me, as I am still here, searching, and I promise to you that I will find you, we will be reunited once again, and I will make things right for you, for us, for everyone.
