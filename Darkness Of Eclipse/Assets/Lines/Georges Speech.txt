See, here's the problem I have here, the 'dilemma' if you will. I created the predicament in here, you know, with my 'anomaly', but you see, I don't plan on fixing it, really. I find it quite peaceful in a world by myself without those IDIOTS, and you want to bring them back? We could rule this world together, you and I. We could be the superiors and show those PASTLINGS who's really in charge, but instead you want to side with my cowardice fool of a sister, because all you petty lot want to do is play with your little old friends in your little old homes. Is that really what you want?
