Have you ever stopped to think about how small we are? Not just to our universe, but to our reality as well. People always assume that the multiverse is infinite because of how big it is, but if you take into consideration that time and space can only be so specific, you'll find that eternity is very much finite. It's as beautiful as it is terrifying to think about, the fact that we will eventually repeat things due to our universe running out of original events, or maybe the future has already happened.
