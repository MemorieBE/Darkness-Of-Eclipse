Stop! Don't move. She's right behind you.
If you've looked at her already, Do not lose your gaze otherwise she will snap.
I don't mean to make you panic, in fact please don't panic, otherwise you will die.
She will kill you if you move, she will try to sneak up on you
If she does, look at her, but whatever you do,
don't look back.
