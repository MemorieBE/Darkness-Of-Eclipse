Okay, she's gone now.

Look, I know you're confused, but I can explain. 
That was the ghost of this world. 
She's been here a lot longer than even I have. 
She's nothing but an old stencile of anger and hate, 
made up of the memories from the distant past and the inevitable future. 
Whoever she once was or whatever form it once possesed, 
had been disbanded for a very, very long time.

I call her the Unvermeidlich, meaning the inevitable, 
or just the Unver, meaning the unchanged.
She's her own biggest threat,
her own biggest regret.
The dark to remember,
the light to forget.

Oh thank god. Home sweet home, am I right? You must be so exhausted, why don't you take a nap? Don't worry, I'll still be here for when you wake up, and who knows, maybe this is all just a bad dream.
